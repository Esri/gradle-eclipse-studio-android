# Build ArcGIS Android Eclipse project with Gradle
A gradle build project structure to retain Eclipse compatibility after migrating ArcGIS Android SDK projects to Android Studio.

# Developer Instructions

## Fork the repo
If you haven't already, fork the [this repo](https://github.com/Esri/gradle-eclipse-studio-android/fork).

## Clone the repo
### Command line Git
[Clone the Gradle Eclipse Studio Android repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)

Open your terminal, navigate to your working directory, use ```git clone``` to get a copy of the repo.

```bash
# Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gradle-eclipse-studio-android.git
```

## Download the SDK
In order to work with this repo you need to download the local ArcGIS Android SDK.  Get v10.2.5 [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/downloads/).  

## Add ArcGIS Android libs
Once you have downloaded the SDK, extract it to disk and copy the contents from your local SDK install **libs/** directory to the root level in this project.  Below is what your projects **libs/** directory should look like after you have added them in:

## Build Script explained
### Eclipse configuration
First we configure the classpath file.  In generating we add entries for Android Gradle based source location as shown below:  

```groovy
// Configuring Eclipse classpath
eclipse.classpath.file {


  // Direct manipulation of the generated classpath XML
  withXml {

    // Since non-default source directories are used
    // they need to be manually added to the classpath XML
    def node = it.asNode()

    // Main source directory
    node.appendNode('classpathentry kind="src" path="src/main/java"')

    // Generated code directory
    node.appendNode('classpathentry kind="src" path="gen"')

  }

}
```

Then we configure the Eclipse project.  The project name can be changed to the name you will see in the Eclipse project explorer.  Then we set the Android nature and builders to let Eclipse know that this is an Android Project.  

```groovy
// Configuring Eclipse project
eclipse.project {
  // Project name that will appear in your project explorer
  name = 'ArcGISAndroid'

  // Letting Eclipse know that the project is Android
  natures 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.AndroidNature'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ResourceManagerBuilder'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.PreCompilerBuilder'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ApkBuilder'
}
```

## Project Structure
File structure has changed for Gradle based Android Studio projects.  Eclipse is more restrictive than Android Studio as you can use Gradle to work with almost any file structure you describe in the source sets of the build script.  Here are the artifacts that Eclipse will not let you move:  

* AndroidManifext.xml
* res/
* assets/

So we define them separately in the build script.  

```groovy
sourceSets {
  main {
    manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'
    res.srcDirs = ['res']
    assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
  }
```

## Usage
Now that you have set up the repo project and contextualized the gradle build script (build.gradle) you can generate projects with cross-IDE compatibility between Eclipse and Android Studio based on the gradle build tool.  Use this command to setup Eclipse project.

```
$ gradle cleanEclipse eclipse --info
```

## Open project in Eclipse or Android Studio
You can now open the project in Eclipse or import into Android Studio.
