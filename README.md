# Build ArcGIS Android Eclipse project with Gradle
A gradle build project structure to retain Eclipse compatibility after migrating ArcGIS Android SDK projects to Android Studio.

## Usage
Use this command to setup Eclipse project.
```
$ gradle cleanEclipse eclipse --info
```

## Build Script
### Eclipse configuration
First we configure the classpath file manually.  In generating we add entries for Android Gradle based source location.  

```groovy
// Configuring Eclipse classpath
eclipse.classpath.file {


  // Direct manipulation of the generated classpath XML
  withXml {

    // Since non-default source directories are used
    // they need to be manually added to the classpath XML
    def node = it.asNode()

    // Main source directory
    node.appendNode('classpathentry kind="src" path="src/main/java"')

    // Generated code directory
    node.appendNode('classpathentry kind="src" path="gen"')

  }

}
```

Then we configure the Eclipse project.  The project name can be changed to the name you will see in the Ecilpse project explorer.  Then we set the Android nature and builders to let Eclipse know that this is an Android Project.  

```groovy
// Configuring Eclipse project
eclipse.project {
  // Project name that will appear in your project explorer
  name = 'ArcGISAndroid'

  // Letting Eclipse know that the project is Android
  natures 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.AndroidNature'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ResourceManagerBuilder'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.PreCompilerBuilder'
  buildCommand 'com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ApkBuilder'
}
```


## Project Structure
File structure has changed for Gradle based Android Studio projects.  Eclipse is more restrictive than Android Studio as you can use Gradle to work with almost any file structure you describe in the source sets of the build script.  Here are the artifacts that Ecilpse will not let you move:  

* AndroidManifext.xml
* res/
* assets/

So we define them separately in the build script.  

```groovy
sourceSets {
  main {
    manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'
    res.srcDirs = ['res']
    assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
  }
```

## Open project in Eclipse or Android Studio
You can now open the project in Eclipse or import into Android Studio.
